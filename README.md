wipy-hd44780
============

Quick-hack controller code for HD44780-based LCD's. Tossed this together to
control a couple of boards I got recently. This library _should_ work for 16x1,
16x2, 20x2, 40x2, and 20x4 LCD screens driven by Hitachi HD44780-compatible
controllers.

The code uses a relatively naive bit-banging approach. If you'd like to clean it
up or optimize for real-world usage, feel free to fork and submit a pull request
(to the develop branch!)
